# Build Scala Android apps using Scala

sbt-android-plugin is an extension for the Scala build tool [sbt][] which
aims to make it as simple as possible to get started with Scala on Android.

Together with [giter8][] you can create and build a simple Android Scala project in a
matter of minutes.

## Getting started

See the [Getting started][] guide on the wiki for more documentation. In case
you're not not familiar with sbt make sure to check out its excellent
[Getting Started Guide][sbt-getting-started] first.

## Hacking on the plugin

If you need make modifications to the plugin itself, you can compile
and install it locally (you need at least sbt 0.11.x to build it):

    $ git clone git://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin.git
    $ cd android-plugin
    $ sbt publish-local

## Migrating from 0.7.x

For those who are familiar with the 0.7.x plugin, there is a [migration guide][]
for a quick reference. The 0.7.x version is no longer maintained - but it is
still available in the [0.7.x][] branch.

## Mailing list

There's no official mailing list for the project but most contributors hang
out in [scala-on-android][] or [simple-build-tool][].

You can also check out a list of
[projects using sbt-android-plugin][] to see some real-world examples.
